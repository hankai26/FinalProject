**Background**   



The AnalyzeUp team will present philanthropy propensity giving tools using 
published Annual Report Data and APIs from Charity Navigator(https://www.charitynavigator.org/)        
for the nonprofit sector.  Our main focus is to develop tools for corporate engagement within 
nonprofit organizations and their contributions to supporting them. 

**Mission**
AnalyzeUp is motivated through the expectation of aiding the nonprofit sector with our supplied tools in order to fundraise to resolve the world's greatest social issues.

**Key Questions**
1) What requirements must be considered to create a model that can rate charities?
2) How much financial support is given within each community (impact heatmap) and by cause?
